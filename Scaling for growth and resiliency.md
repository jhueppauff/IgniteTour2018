# Scaling for growth and resiliency

- Resource exhaustion under load 
- application ceases to meet its objective
- aticipated/unanticipated load (spikes are tricky)

## Scaling types

- scaling up (vertical)
  - box is not big enough to serve
  - default way for eg. sql
- scaling down (horizontal)
  - makes more sense for web apps
