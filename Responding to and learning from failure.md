# Responding to and learning from failure

- responding to crises is not idiosyncratic work. it is soemthing that is done all the time

- it is theis repsomsivemess that is therir soruce of reliability

## Reality, reacting to failure means

- unplanned work
- context switching
- confusion
- increased time to repair

## Mean time to recover (MTTR)

- on average how long does it tkae to resore service when a service incident occurs

## Costs of Downtime

deployment frequency X change failure rate X mean to to recover X hourly costs of outage

On top, impact on your brand, software name etc..

Slowness is the new DOWN.

## Fine (strinkthoruhg)

- Alerts to inbox
- alerts to common (ops) channel
- shoulder tapping
- delays in communication
- tiered and off-shore support
- network operations center (NOC)

## Communication & Collobaration

- Create Space
  - a dedicated space to talk just about that case
    - e.g. dedicated and persisted chat, no conference call (talk over other)
    - timestamps for Post Review
- Alert First Reponder(s)
  - on-call FRs
- Alert Additional Stackholders
  - internal and external stackholders
    - eg. support team
    - eg. customer (e.g. Statuspages, social media (consumer facing services))

## Roles

### Incident Commander

- lead coordination and decicion maker during an active incident

### Subject Matter Experts

- engineers with experties and knowledge relevant to the recovery of service

### Scribe

- responsible for documentation what is not captured in team chat

### communication coordinator

responsible for communication regularly with internal and external stackholders

## Chat Ops

Putting the Tools into the chat enviroment

- Increase collaboration
- increased sharing of domain knowlage
- increased visibilty and awareness
- enhanced learning
- improved empathy
- pushing context
- read-only data retrieval
- bi-directional interactions
- custom infrastructure interaction

## PIR (Post Incident Review)

- deeper understanding of the incident
- summary
- artifact

=> maximize the opportunity to learn

Give time after an incident but do them on a short notice.
Memory starts to fade after 36 hours

### Involved people

- First Responder
- Escalation responders
- incident commander
- additional stackholders
- external moderator

### What did they know

### when did they know it

### how did it make snese

### time line of events

- (TTA) through remediation (TRR)
- Telemetry
- Chat transcript

Response isn't linear


### Beyond the timeline

- positive impact task
- negative impact task
- no impact tasks

- conversations
- dissonance

### Socio technical

- what was the htought process when the engineer took that

### Accountibiality

### countermessures

- new automated tests
- add additinal temetry to fill blind spots

### Aritfacts

- Internal and External Summary

- Services Impacted
- Duration
- Severty
- Customer impact

### Kill the root cause analysis

they dont help!

concentrate on analysis of the incident response
